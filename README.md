This project is a SARIMA modeling of Gold Prices. 

Since ancient civilizations, from the Egyptians to the Inca, gold has held a special place of actual and symbolic value for humanity. Nowadays, of its relative scarcity and historical importance, gold is considered a store of value, and for some investors, a long-term investment. Therefore, modeling gold prices may offer valuable insights into gold tradings, especially in the days when inflation is at its peak.  

Inspired by “Why Has Gold Always Been Valuable?” (Carla Tardi, Jan 2022), along with the fact that we are living in an increasingly violent era where inflation is surging, we believe a significant proportion of people are considering buying various kinds of precious metals to preserve wealth. Gold is the first choice. I'm interested in whether statistical modeling should prove beneficial for investment decisions. 
During my search for the topic to explore the feasibility of statistical modeling of gold prices, I came across a paper by Banhi Guha, “Gold Price Forecasting Using ARIMA Model” (March 2016). Based on the findings in this paper and multiple other sources, I determined that SARIMA models best fit the time-series nature of gold prices and our skillsets.
